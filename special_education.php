		Special education or special needs education is the practice of educating students with special needs in a way that addresses their individual differences and needs. Common special needs include learning disabilities, communication disabilities, emotional and behavioral disorders, physical disabilities, and developmental disabilities. Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching, the use of technology, a specifically adapted teaching area, or a resource room.
         In our school a special education program is customized to address each individual student's unique needs. The assessment is done with the assessment worksheets prepared according to the class of the student. Special educators provide a continuum of services, in which students with special needs receives varying degrees of support based on their individual needs. Remedial instruction aims at improving a skill or ability in a student. 
       Techniques for remedial instruction may include providing more practice or more explanation, repeating information, and devoting more time to working on the skill. For example, a student having a low reading level could be given remediation via one-on-one reading instruction, phonics instruction, or practice in reading aloud. Early intervention of a child with special needs takes place in our school. If a student is struggling with a subject, interventions can be made to help that student along. Focus on getting the student to produce quality work and not quantity.
