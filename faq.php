		<b>Q1. What is the process of evaluation?</b>  <br />
		Evaluation is the integral part of teaching - learning process. It is an ongoing process which tells us from time to time whether the learning objectives laid down, have been achieved.<br />
        V.V.V education board follows the guidelines set by RBSE, i.e. continuous evaluation. The students are evaluated on the basis of their monthly performance in class. A programme report after every unit is given.<br />
 	    A formal date sheet along with details of the examination pattern is given to each and every student at the beginning of the session. <hr />
		<b>Q2. I (Parent) have a problem in the seating arrangement of the classroom?</b>  <br />
		In the primary section, the seating arrangement and the partners are rotated on a regular basis so that bonding can be developed between the students and also the students develop the qualities of tolerance and ability to adjust. In case there is any other problem the parent can discuss with the class teacher concerned.<hr />
